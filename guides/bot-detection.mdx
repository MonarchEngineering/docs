## Overview

Airtop is designed to avoid bot detection as much as possible. We use a variety of techniques to do this, including:
* Running a real browser in the cloud, not a headless browser
* Advanced fingerprinting techniques
* Residential proxy network integration
* Automated captcha solving
* And much more...

For the most part, you don't have to worry about bot detection and configuration; Airtop takes care of it for you. However, there are a few things you can do to help if you run into issues. We'll cover some of these in this guide.

## Configuring Residential Proxies

By default, Airtop issues traffic from within a cloud data center. However, some sites will block traffic coming from the cloud. To avoid this, you can configure Airtop to use a residential proxy network. 

If you notice that your agent is being blocked or presented with a CAPTCHA, you can try enabling the integrated proxy network by going to the Agent's Settings page and enabling the Integrated proxy.

This will route traffic through a residential proxy network, which is less likely to be blocked by sites. Your agents may run slightly slower with this option enabled, but it's a good way to avoid being blocked. You can specify the proxy country you want to use.

### Using Your Own Proxy Server

The integrated proxy service has a few domains that it cannot access. If you try to access one of these domains, you'll see a failure to load the site. These domains are:

* Some streaming services (e.g., Netflix)
* Some banking and other financial institutions
* Ticketing sites like Ticketmaster

If you need to access one of these domains, you can use a custom proxy instead, which may have fewer restrictions. In this model, you pay the proxy provider directly and simply give us the configuration options to be used by your agents.

Here are some providers that we've tested and have reasonable quality:
1. [Oxylabs](https://oxylabs.io)
2. [Smartproxy](https://smartproxy.com)
3. [IPRoyal](https://iproyal.com)


## Constraining Your Agent's Behavior

In some cases, it's not the source of traffic that is being blocked, but rather the behavior of the agent itself that may be detected as bot-like. To help avoid this, you can configure your agent to behave more like a human.

For example, slow down your agent's actions or restrict the number of actions per session. Say you're extracting content from a website and navigating to 1000 pages as quickly as possible. That may be detected as bot-like behavior, whereas going to 10 pages within a few minutes may not be. You can ask the Assistant to slow down the agent's actions, or restrict the number of actions per session.

If you are getting blocked, not upon loading a site, but after a few seconds or minutes of activity, think about what you're doing that appears non-human, and ask the Assistant to adjust your agent's behavior.
