## Overview

Airtop is designed to avoid bot detection as much as possible. We use a variety of techniques to do this, including:
* Running a real browser in the cloud, not a headless browser
* Advanced fingerprinting techniques
* Residential proxy network Integration
* Automated captcha solving
* And many more...

For the most part, you don't have to worry about bot detection and configuration; Airtop takes care of it for you. However, there are a few things you can do to help if you run into issues.
