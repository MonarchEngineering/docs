There are two ways to get started with Airtop. You can either start an agent from scratch, or you can use one of our pre-built agent templates.

## Use a Template

Templates are the fastest way to start automating with Airtop.

Airtop templates are pre-built, customizable automations built by the Airtop community. These templates have been tested and approved by Airtop.

Remixing a template takes substantially less time than building a custom agent. They also require fewer credits to build with than starting from scratch, as much of the automation code has already been written.

To remix a template, go to [airtop.ai/templates](https://www.airtop.ai/templates), select a template that fits you needs, and click "Try Agent." Then simply tell the Agent Builder how you'd like to change the template. If the template is good to go as-is, then you will just need to connect any necessary integrations and adjust any desired parameters.

If you will need to radically change a template to fit your needs – for instance, if the template has little to do with your intended use-case – then it will be faster to start from scratch.

## Start from Scratch

If there are no templates that fit your automation needs, then you can build an agent from scratch.

Navigate to: [portal.airtop.ai/agents](https://portal.airtop.ai/agents)

Sign in or create an account if needed.

**Creating a New Agent**

Click "+ Create New Agent" in the top righthand corner of the Airtop Portal.

Then describe what you want to automate. It is best to be clear and concise with your prompt.

Start from a simple prompt, then work with the Agent Builder to expand and fine-tune your automation. For instance, _"Build an automation that reads new messages in a Slack channel, creates a summary of those messages, and then sends that Summary to a different Slack channel"_ is a good prompt.

**Working with the Agent Builder**

The Agent Builder will work with you to connect any integrations you'll need (like Slack), specify which Slack channel(s) to monitor, which channel to send the summary to, and what kind of summary to create. There is no need to specify all of this information in the intial prompt.

If you see that the Agent Builder is doing something you don't want it to do, you can correct it at any time in the chat box.

Agent sessions are **saved automatically**. If you need to leave the agent builder, or your session times out, you can return to the same project and pick up where you left off.

**Deploying and Scheduling an Agent**

Once you are satisfied with your agent, it's time to deploy! Click "Deploy" in the top-right corner. This will finalize your agent and make it available for scheduling and triggering.

Agents can be scheduled to run automatically, or they can be triggered by Webhooks.

You can also trigger an agent manually by clicking "Run" next to "Past Runs" on the Agent page.

**Creating a Template**

If you want to submit your agent to the Airtop community, click "Share." This will automatically anonymize any sensitive data in your Agent (API keys, login information, etc) and create a template description page. You can edit the template description page or leave it as-is, and submit your template to the Airtop team for review.
