## What is Airtop?

Airtop is a platform for building and deploying AI agents that can perform repetitive tasks on your behalf, all running in the cloud, doing work for you while you sleep.

Airtop is designed for highly repetitive tasks where you need a high degree of accuracy and reliability. It's perfect for tasks like:
* I need to monitor my competitor's pricing and adjust my own accordingly
* I need to triage my incoming sales leads, research the companies, and assign a lead score
* I need to monitor my social media accounts and engage with my followers
* Anything else you can think of that you do regularly and want to automate

Airtop uses APIs for some Integrations, but uses a web browser for anything else. If you can open it in a browser, Airtop can automate it.
