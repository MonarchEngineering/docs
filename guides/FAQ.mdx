## Getting Started with Airtop Agents

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What should I automate with Airtop Agents?">
    Airtop Agents are best for automating **repetitive**  tasks on the web. Airtop Agents can click, scroll, scrape, login, and interact with dynamic websites. If you have tasks which you find yourself doing on a regular basis that involve using the web (like logging into portals, filling out forms, or scraping data), Airtop is a good tool for automating these tasks.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What are Airtop Agent Templates?">
    Airtop [Templates](https://www.airtop.ai/templates) are pre-built, customizable AI Agents that have been tested and approved by the Airtop team. The automation code has already been written, so starting with an Airtop Template uses fewer credits than building an Agent from scratch. To customize a template, simply click **Try Agent**  and chat with the Agent Builder to customize it to your needs. 
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Are Airtop Agent Templates customizable?">
    Yes! You can customize any Agent Template by clicking **Try Agent**, then chatting with the Agent Builder to adjust the template to your needs. If you need your automation to do something very different from any available template, we recommend creating a new Agent and starting from scratch.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I make changes to my Airtop Agent after it’s already deployed?">
    Yes. Simply go to the Agent page and describe what you want to change in the "Make changes to your agent..." field. You can then work with the Agent Builder to refine and update your Agent's behavior.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I trigger my Airtop Agent from external tools?">
    To trigger an Agent when an event happens in an external tool (like Slack, Gmail, GitHub, HubSpot, or Airtable), use the **Connect** panel on the Agent page.

    - **Webhooks:** Select "Other" to generate a webhook endpoint URL. Then embed this webhook url in the tool or website of your choice.
    - **Automation Platforms:** You can run Airtop Agents directly inside an [n8n](https://n8n.io), Zapier, or [Make.com](https://www.make.com/en/integrations/airtop) workflow. This allows you to trigger your agents with Slack, Google Forms, and thousands of other external apps and tools.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title='What is "Cloud Browsing"?'>
    **Cloud Browsing** runs web browser sessions on secure remote servers instead of your local device. In the context of Airtop, this means we provide a managed infrastructure where your AI Agents can navigate the live web, interact with applications, and extract data at scale. This eliminates the need for you to manage complex server infrastructure, handle anti-bot detection, or worry about browser scalability. You can run many Airtop Agents simultaneously thanks to Cloud Browsing.

    Cloud Browsing is contrasted with **Client-side Browsing**, which runs directly on your local device (like your laptop). Client-side browsing uses your personal CPU, memory, and internet connection. While this is standard for personal use, it is difficult to scale for automation because it relies on your specific hardware limitations and local IP address, making it easier for websites to block.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I leave my Agent Builder session and come back to it?">
    Yes! Your Agent Builder progress is automatically saved, so you can leave the session whenever you want. When you return, you can pick up where you left off with the Agent Builder.
  </Accordion>

## Technical & Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do Airtop Agents handle 2FA/MFA?">
    Airtop manages Multi-Factor Authentication (2FA) by preserving your authenticated state. You can use a **Live Browser View** to log in to the target website manually and complete the 2FA challenge. Airtop then saves this session as a **Profile** (storing cookies and browsing artifacts), which allows your automated Agents to run subsequently without being prompted for 2FA again.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="I am encountering too many CAPTCHAs when using the Agent Browser. How do I fix this?">
    You can make Agent logins more reliable by using the **Proxy** setting. A proxy routes your agent traffic through a residential IP, closely mimicking human behavior. This prevents CAPTCHA loops when trying to login using the Agent Browser Window.

    4. Click the gear icon on the top right of the Agent Builder or Portal.
    4. Select **Proxy** -\> **Integrated**.
    3. Choose your desired country (we recommend **United States** for most uses).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Does Airtop store my login credentials?">
    No. Airtop **does not** store your actual login credentials (username/password) when you sign in using the Airtop browser. When you create a Profile to maintain your authentication state, Airtop only stores the encrypted cookies and browsing artifacts required to tell websites you are signed in.

## Billing & Credits

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="When do credits renew?">
    Credits renew monthly on all subscription plans, including the Free plan. Your renewal date is the specific day of the month you subscribed to your plan. For Free plans, it is the day of the month you originally created your account.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do credits in the Free plan renew?">
    Yes, credits in the Free plan renew monthly. You receive **1,000 credits** each month with the Free plan to build and test your agents.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do unused credits roll over to the next month?">
    Yes. If you don't use all your credits during the month, unused credits roll over to the next billing cycle, up to **2× your monthly allotment**.

    - _Example:_ With a 30,000-credit plan, you can accrue up to 60,000 credits in a single period (monthly credits + rollover).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How can I check my credit balance?">
    You can check your current balance in the Airtop Portal:

    1. Click on your organization name (bottom left corner).
    2. Select **Organization Settings**.
    3. Select **Billing**.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I buy more credits if I run out?">
    If you run out of credits, you can upgrade to a subscription with a higher credit allowance. The upgrade is **prorated**, meaning you will only pay for the days remaining until your next billing cycle, and you will receive credits proportional to that remaining period.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How can I upgrade or downgrade my subscription?">
    To change your subscription plan, visit the **Plans** page in your Organization Settings: https://portal.airtop.ai/settings/organization/plans
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What is the refund policy?">
    You can request a refund of your last subscription charge if the following criteria are met:

    - The charge occurred within the last **5 business days**.
    - No credits were used in the last billing period.

    To request a refund, please email [support@airtop.ai](mailto:support@airtop.ai) from the email account linked to your Airtop account.
