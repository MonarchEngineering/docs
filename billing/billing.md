## How Credits Work

Airtop uses **credits** to power usage across the platform. Each subscription plan includes a monthly credit allowance that refreshes automatically.

### When do credits renew?

- Credits renew **every month** on **all plans**, including the Free plan.
- Your renewal date is:
  - The day you subscribed to a paid plan, or
  - The day you created your account if you’re on the Free plan.


## Free Plan Credits

- The **Free plan includes 1,000 credits every month**.
- These credits **automatically renew**, so you always start each month with a fresh allowance.


## Credit Rollover (Unused Credits)

If you don’t use all your credits in a month, you don’t lose them right away.

- Unused credits **roll over to the next billing cycle**.
- You can accumulate up to **2× your monthly credit limit**.
- For example:
  - On a **30,000-credit plan**, you can hold up to **60,000 credits** total (monthly credits + rollover).

This gives you flexibility if your usage varies from month to month.


## What If I Need More Credits?

If you run out of credits, you can move to a plan with a higher allowance.

- Airtop does not offer one-off credit purchases.
- **Upgrades are prorated**, meaning:
  - You only pay for the remaining time in your current billing cycle.
  - You’ll receive **credits based on the time left** in that cycle.

This makes it easy to scale up without paying for unused time.


## Changing Your Subscription Plan

You can upgrade or downgrade your plan at any time.

1. Go to **Organization Settings → Plans**, or visit:  
   https://portal.airtop.ai/settings/organization/plans
2. Choose the plan that best fits your needs.

Plan changes take effect immediately and are reflected in your billing.


## Refunds

If Airtop doesn’t work for your use case, you may be eligible for a refund.

You can request a refund for your **most recent subscription charge** if:

- The charge was made **within the last 5 business days**, and
- **No credits were used** during the current billing period.

To request a refund, email **support@airtop.ai** from the email address associated with your Airtop account.

> Please note: Airtop’s refund policy may change over time.


## Viewing Your Credit Balance

You can always check how many credits you have left from your dashboard.

- Visit the **Billing page** directly:  
  https://portal.airtop.ai/settings/organization/billing

Or navigate there manually:
1. Click your **organization name** in the bottom-left corner
2. Select **Organization Settings**
3. Open **Billing**
